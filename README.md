## avocado-attenborough.rs
... is a small executable that sets my screen brightness.

## firejail-locals
... contains all the local customizations I wish to retain for my
firejail usage.

## lychee-stamps.py
... verifies that a file full of timestamps and durations describes a
continuous timeline - i.e. that each duration spans the whole track into
the next timestamp, leaving no holes and causing no bleed-ins. It's used
to verify my work for cutting the score-only extract from TLJ.

## xkpw
... generates nonrandom passwords.

## undue\_instagram.py
... scrapes Instagram photos.

## dovizu\_ando.py:
... is a game used to practice hiragana.

## nanisore.sh:
... is a shell script that quickly spits out a screenful of processes
ordered by top memory usage, CPU consumption, or process state.

## unskipper.py
... is a Python script that prunes skipcounts from your Quod Libet
library. It's a selfish tic of mine that I don't like seeing nonzero
skipcounts on my songs because usually they happen by accident, and of
course increase proportionally with the number of times I listen to a
song (probably nonlinearly). It'll zero out all skipcounts in your
library by popping the associated key from the dictionaries in your
library and write the results back to disk.
