# katowice 

... is a potpourri of projects I cobble together in my spare time. They have no coherence, no point, no taste. What else could they be for but to stroke my ego? 

## ubans 

... is a python script that permutes words. Specifically, running 

`ubans(word)` 

prints out all the permutations of the word argument. The print statements are all tiled twice across, because this script came about as a result of curiosity over how else I could express "snabu snabu" besides "ubans ubans."
